Genesys 20 days Coding Challenge

Day 11 - Analog Clock

Picking up the broken pieces, Doing this challenge helped me realise how much info are just there on the internet and how much open source is contributing. Literally everything I searched for was just there cause had no idea how to make a clock at first. 

I do hope to contribute back to the Open Source Community for all i have gotten, the sky is big enough for everyone to fly.
